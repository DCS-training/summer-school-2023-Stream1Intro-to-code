    "2. There are **TEXT CELLS** like this one with explanations of concepts. They are called 'Markdown' in the dropdown menu bar, at the top of your Noteable.\n",
    "3. And **CODE CELLS** with Python code (see below). Code cells have a ```In []``` written to the left.\n",
    "4. You can **RUN CODE CELLS** by clicking on them and pressing **Shift + Enter**. When you run a cell, the code inside will run (it \"happens\", the computer will do what you asked for it to do). Results of what your code does will appear underneath the cell.\n",
    "5. As we go through these lessons, please READ text cells, and RUN code cells.\n",
