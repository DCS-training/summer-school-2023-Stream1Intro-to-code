    "## What is Pair Programming? \n",
    "\n",
    "Hello, during the labs I would like you all to work in pairs, using the **'Pair Programming'** method. It's a collaboration technique very popular in programming and part of **'Agile Programming'** manifesto. Basically almost everything good in programming came out of Agile manifesto :)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pair Programming there are two roles: 'Driver' and 'Navigator'. You and your partner will take turns driving, and will change every 10-15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Driver: 'Person who types on the keyboard and uses the mouse. You read and write in the notebook.'**  You will have the code opened in front of you and will be sharing your screen. Your job is to think out loud as you read the notes and solve the exercises. Your job is to talk the navigator through solving the puzzles. As you describe things, to them you will both find out if you understand it all correctly.\n",
    "- **Navigator: 'Person who asks questions, points out improvements and helps the driver'**. You are viewing the driver's screen and asking questions, making sure that you both understand what the notes are saying. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This method feels a bit weird at first, but you will quickly get used to it. It has been used in programming, but also editing text, drawing and other types of pair work. The basic principle is: One person 'holds the pen' and the other person 'asks questions', and then you swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I would like you to try the very basic scenario of driving and navigating."

    "### Pair Programming Remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were sitting side by side in a computer lab, you would:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work on one computer, sitting side-by-side, looking at one screen.\n",
    "- Driver would use the keyboard and mouse.\n",
    "- Navigator would ask questions, maybe look at notes.\n",
    "- Pass the keyboard and mouse to each other, every 15 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because recent circumstances mean this course is primarily delivered online, you will use a slightly adapted version of the above technique for **remote programming via video conference**. As follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Learn Collaborate virtual breakout room. You will both enable your microphones and video (if possible).\n",
    "- Driver will edit a Jupyter Notebook on their screen and share their screen. You'll talk and think out loud.\n",
    "- Navigator will be viewing the Driver's shared screen, aim to follow their reasoning, and ask questions.\n",
    "- When it's time to switch, you will swap ownership of the notebook **(described below)**, and Navigator will share their screen and become the new Driver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time one of you may read or type much faster than the other. Or maybe you already grasped a concept that your partner is still digesting. Working together like this is your opportunity to help each other, but also to **understand things better, because you had to explain them to someone**. This is called \"Rubber Ducking\" and we'll talk about it more soon.\n",

    "3. Continue going through this notebook with the other person being the new Driver.\n",
    "    * It is customary to have a short debrief as you switch, and ask questions like: \"Was I going too quickly?\", \"Did you feel okay when I asked questions?\", \"Could you see my screen properly?\", \"Did I scroll too much\", etc.\n",
    "4. If you completed this notebook and still have time, open one of the other code notebooks for this course, and start going through it with your partner."

    "\n",
