Another problem could be that if you somehow dug up a very repetitive file (eg. eg an .mp3 music file with a lot of silence) you might end up with a lot of repeated numbers and some numbers missing completely (eg. if mp3 files use 0 to describe silence you would get disproportionately many 0 in your randomness).\n",

One way to avoid the 'repetitive noise' like in the above example of mp3 file is what Python does: it uses some SEED as the address of  RANDOM_VALUE_1, and then instead of reading the next piece of noise it finde, it uses the value of RANDOM_VALUE_1 as an address in noise to find RANDOM_VALUE_2. And then if uses 'ranom' RANDOM_VALUE_2 as the address to find RANDOM_VALUE_3 and so on. \n",
